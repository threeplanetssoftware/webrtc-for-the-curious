<a class=anchor href=#rtp>#</a></h3><p>RTP and RTCP is the protocol that handles all media transport for WebRTC. It was defined in <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1889>RFC 1889</a> in January 1996.
We are very lucky to have one of the authors <a href=https://github.com/ronf>Ron Frederick</a> talk about it himself. Ron recently uploaded
<a href=https://github.com/ronf/nv>Network Video tool</a>, a project that informed RTP.</p><p><strong>In his own words:</strong></p><p>In October of 1992, I began to experiment with the Sun VideoPix frame grabber
card, with the idea of writing a network videoconferencing tool based upon IP
multicast. It was modeled after &ldquo;vat&rdquo; &ndash; an audioconferencing tool developed
at LBL, in that it used a similar lightweight session protocol for users
joining into conferences, where you simply sent data to a particular
multicast group and watched that group for any traffic from other group
members.</p><p>In order for the program to really be successful, it needed to compress the
video data before putting it out on the network. My goal was to make an
acceptable looking stream of data that would fit in about 128 kbps, or the
bandwidth available on a standard home ISDN line. I also hoped to produce
something that was still watchable that fit in half this bandwidth. This
meant I needed approximately a factor of 20 in compression for the particular
image size and frame rate I was working with. I was able to achieve this
compression and filed for a patent on the techniques I used, later granted
as patent <a href=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5485212A>US5485212A</a>: Software video compression for teleconferencing.</p><p>In early November of 1992, I released the videoconferencing tool &ldquo;nv&rdquo; (in
binary form) to the Internet community. After some initial testing, it was used
to videocast parts of the November Internet Engineering Task Force all around
the world. Approximately 200 subnets in 15 countries were capable of
receiving this broadcast, and approximately 50-100 people received video using
&ldquo;nv&rdquo; at some point in the week.</p><p>Over the next couple of months, three other workshops and some smaller
meetings used &ldquo;nv&rdquo; to broadcast to the Internet at large, including the
Australian NetWorkshop, the MCNC Packet Audio and Video workshop, and the
MultiG workshop on distributed virtual realities in Sweden.</p><p>A source code release of &ldquo;nv&rdquo; followed in February of 1993, and in March I
released a version of the tool where I introduced a new wavelet-based
compression scheme. In May of 1993, I added support for color video.</p><p>The network protocol used for &ldquo;nv&rdquo; and other Internet conferencing tools
became the basis of the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP), standardized
through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), first published in
RFCs <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1889>1889</a>-<a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1890>1890</a> and later revised in RFCs <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550>3550</a>-<a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3551>3551</a>
along with various other RFCs that covered profiles for carrying specific
formats of audio and video.</p><p>Over the next couple of years, work contined on &ldquo;nv&rdquo;, porting the tool
to a number of additional hardware platforms and video capture devices.
It continued to be used as one of the primary tools for broadcasting
conferences on the Internet at the time, including being selected by NASA
to broadcast live coverage of shuttle missions online.</p><p>In 1994, I added support in &ldquo;nv&rdquo; for supporting video compression algorithms
developed by others, including some hardware compression schemes such as
the CellB format supported by the SunVideo video capture card. This also
allowed &ldquo;nv&rdquo; to send video in CUSeeMe format, to send video to users
running CUSeeMe on Macs and PCs.</p><p>The last publicly released version of &ldquo;nv&rdquo; was version 3.3beta, released
in July of 1994. I was working on a &ldquo;4.0alpha&rdquo; release that was intended
to migrate &ldquo;nv&rdquo; over to version 2 of the RTP protocol, but this work was
never completed due to my moving on to other projects. A copy of the 4.0
alpha code is included in the <a href=https://github.com/ronf/nv>Network Video tool</a>
archive for completeness, but it is unfinished and there are known issues
with it, particularly in the incomplete RTPv2 support.</p><p>The framework provided in &ldquo;nv&rdquo; later went on to become the basis of video
conferencing in the &ldquo;Jupiter multi-media MOO&rdquo; project at Xerox PARC, which
eventually became the basis for a spin-off company &ldquo;PlaceWare&rdquo;, later
acquired by Microsoft. It was also used as the basis for a number of
hardware video conferencing projects that allowed sending of full NTSC
broadcast quality video over high-bandwidth Ethernet and ATM networks.
I also later used some of this code as the basis for &ldquo;Mediastore&rdquo;, which
was a network-based video recording and playback service.</p><p><strong>Do you remember the motivations/ideas of the other people on the draft?</strong></p><p>We were all researchers working on IP multicast, and helping to create
the Internet multicast backbone (aka MBONE). The MBONE was created by
Steve Deering (who first developed IP multicast), Van Jacobson, and Steve
Casner. Steve Deering and I had the same advisor at Stanford, and Steve
ended up going to work at Xerox PARC when he left Stanford, I spent a
summer at Xerox PARC as an intern working on IP multicast-related projects
and continued to work for them part time while at Stanford and later full
time. Van Jacobson and Steve Casner were two of the four authors on
the initial RTP RFCs, along with Henning Schulzrinne and myself. We all
had MBONE tools that we were working on that allowed for various forms of
online collaboration, and trying to come up with a common base protocol
all these tools could use was what led to RTP.</p><p><strong>Multicast is super fascinating. WebRTC is entirely unicast, mind expanding on
that?</strong></p><p>Before getting to Stanford and learning about IP multicast, I had a
long history working on ways to use computers as a way for people to
communicate with one another. This started in the early 80s for me
where I ran a dial-up bulletin board system where people could log on
and leave messages for one another, both private (sort of the equivalent
of e-mail) and public (discussion groups). Around the same time, I also
learned about the online service provider CompuServe. One of the cool
features on CompuServe was something called a “CB Simulator” where people
could talk to one another in real-time. It was all text-based, but it
had a notion of “channels” like a real CB radio, and multiple people
could see what others typed, as long as they were in the same channel.
I built my own version of CB which ran on a timesharing system I had
access to which let users on that system send messages to one another
in real-time, and over the next few years I worked with friends to
develop more sophisticated versions of real-time communication tools
on several different computer systems and networks. In fact, one of those
systems is still operational, and I use it talk every day to folks I went
to college with 30+ years ago!</p><p>All of those tools were text based, since computers at the time generally
didn’t have any audio/video capabilities, but when I got to Stanford and
learned about IP multicast, I was intrigued by the notion of using multicast
to get something more like a true “radio” where you could send a signal
out onto the network that wasn’t directed at anyone in particular, but
everyone who tuned to that “channel” could receive it. As it happened, the
computer I was porting the IP multicast code to was the first generation
SPARCstation from Sun, and it actually had built-in telephone-quality audio
hardware! You could digitize sound from a microphone and play it back over
built-in speakers (or via a headphone output). So, my first thought was to
figure out how to send that audio out onto the network in real-time using
IP multicast, and see if I could build a “CB radio” equivalent with actual
audio instead of text.</p><p>There were some tricky things to work out, like the fact that the computer
could only play one audio stream at a time, so if multiple people were talking
you needed to mathematically “mix” multiple audio streams into one before
you could play it, but that could all be done in software once you understood
how the audio sampling worked. That audio application led me to working on
the MBONE and eventually moving from audio to video with “nv”.</p><p><strong>Anything that got left out of the protocol that you wish you had added?
Anything in the protocol you regret?</strong></p><p>I wouldn’t say I regret it, but one of the big complaints people ended up
having about RTP was the complexity of implementing RTCP, the control protocol
that ran in parallel with the main RTP data traffic. I think that complexity
was a large part of why RTP wasn’t more widely adopted, particularly in the
unicast case where there wasn’t as much need for some of RTCP’s features.
As network bandwidth became less scarce and congestion wasn’t as big a
problem, a lot of people just ended up streaming audio & video over plain
TCP (and later HTTP), and generally speaking it worked “well enough” that
it wasn’t worth dealing with RTP.</p><p>Unfortunately, using TCP or HTTP meant that multi-party audio and video
applications had to send the same data over the network multiple times,
to each of the peers that needed to receive it, making it much less
efficient from a bandwidth perspective. I sometimes wish we had pushed
harder to get IP multicast adopted beyond just the research community.
I think we could have seen the transition from cable and broadcast
television to Internet-based audio and video much sooner if we had.</p><p><strong>What things did you imagine being built with RTP? Do have any cool RTP
projects/ideas that got lost to time?</strong></p><p>One of the fun things I built was a version of the classic “Spacewar” game
which used IP multicast. Without having any kind of central server, multiple
clients could each run the spacewar binary and start broadcasting their
ship’s location, velocity, the direction it was facing, and similar
information for any “bullets” it had fired, and all of the other instances
would pick up that information and render it locally, allowing users to all
see each other’s ships and bullets, with ships “exploding” if they crashed
into each other or bullets hit them. I even made the “debris” from the
explosion a live object that could take out other ships, sometimes leading
to fun chain reactions!</p><p>In the spirit of the original game, I rendered it using simulated vector
graphics, so you could do things like zooming your view in & out and
everything would scale up/down. The ships themselves were a bunch of
line segments in vector form that I had some of my colleagues at PARC
helped me to design, so everyone’s ship had a unique look to it.</p><p>Basically, anything that could benefit from a real-time data stream that
didn’t need perfect in-order delivery could benefit from RTP. So, in addition
to audio & video we could build things like a shared whiteboard. Even file
transfers could benefit from RTP, especially in conjunction with IP multicast.</p><p>Imagine something like BitTorrent but where you didn’t need all the data
going point-to-point between peers. The original seeder could send a multicast
stream to all of the leeches at once, and any packet losses along the way
could be quickly cleaned up by a retransmission from any peer that
successfully received the data. You could even scope your retransmission
requests so that some peer nearby delivered the copy of the data, and that
too could be multicast to others in that region, since a packet loss in
the middle of the network would tend to mean a bunch of clients
downstream of that point all missed the same data.</p><p><strong>Why did you have to roll your own video compression. Was nothing else
available at the time?</strong></p><p>At the time I began to build “nv”, the only systems I know of that did
videoconferencing were very expensive specialized hardware. For instance,
Steve Casner had access to a system from BBN that was called &ldquo;DVC&rdquo; (and
later commercialized as “PictureWindow”). The compression required
specialized hardware but the decompression could be done in software.
What made “nv” somewhat unique was that both compression and decompression
was being done in software, with the only hardware requirement being
something to digitize an incoming analog video signal.</p><p>Many of the basic concepts about how to compress video existed by then, with
things like the MPEG-1 standard appearing right around the same time “nv”
did, but real-time encoding with MPEG-1 was definitely NOT possible at
the time. The changes I made were all about taking those basic concepts and
approximating them with much cheaper algorithms, where I avoided things like
cosine transforms and floating point, and even avoided integer multiplications
since those were very slow on SPARCstations. I tried to do everything I could
with just additions/subtractions and bit masking and shifting, and that got
back enough speed to still feel somewhat like video.</p><p>Within a year or two of the release of &ldquo;nv&rdquo;, there were many different audio
and video tools to choose from, not only on the MBONE but in other places
like the CU-SeeMe tool built on the Mac. So, it was clearly an idea whose
time had come. I actually ended up making “nv” interoperate with many of
these tools, and in a few cases other tools picked up my “nv” codecs so
they could interoperate when using my compression scheme.</p><h1 id=sdp>SDP
